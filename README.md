# Scala Linear Regression

A simple implementation of linear regression using gradient descent in Scala.

## Features

- CSV dataset loading and manipulation
- Dataset splitting for training and evaluation
- Gradient descent implementation for finding optmal weights
- MSE (Mean Squared Error) calculation
- Custom Matrix implementation with basic operations

## Implementation Details

The project consists of three main components:
- `Dataset`: Handles CSV loading, column selection, and train/test splitting
- `Matrix`: Custom matrix implementation with operations like transpose, multiplication, and element-wise transformations
- `Regression`: Implements the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression
